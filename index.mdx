The **AI or Not API** lets you automatically verify whether **images, audio clips, or videos were created by generative-AI models**. Designed for developers who need fast, reliable content provenance checks—moderation teams, media platforms, forensic analysts, compliance tools, and researchers—our API returns a clear verdict plus confidence scores and model-specific insights in a single call.

**Why use it?**

- **State-of-the-art accuracy** – powered by continually updated detectors trained on the latest generative models (e.g. diffusion, GAN, transformers, etc).
- **Privacy first** – uploaded media are processed and deleted immediately after inference.
- **Granular feedback** – JSON responses include flags for ai detection as well as an ever-expanding list of per-modality specific features
