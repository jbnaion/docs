## Setting up

The **AI or Not API** lets you automatically verify whether **images, audio clips, or videos were created by generative-AI models**. Designed for developers who need fast, reliable content provenance checks—moderation teams, media platforms, forensic analysts, compliance tools, and researchers—our API returns a clear verdict plus confidence scores and model-specific insights in a single call.

**Why use it?**

- **State-of-the-art accuracy** – powered by continually updated detectors trained on the latest generative models (e.g. diffusion, GAN, transformers, etc).
- **Privacy first** – uploaded media are processed and deleted immediately after inference.
- **Granular feedback** – JSON responses include flags for ai detection as well as an ever-expanding list of per-modality specific features
    

**Get started in minutes**

1. **Create an account:** [aiornot.com](https://aiornot.com) – choose any plan that includes API access.
2. **Locate your API key:** Once logged in, head to **API** tab and click copy the generated key.
3. **Call appropriate API endpoint**: The documentation below gives specifics.
    

**Important Notes**

- Unused API credits expire at the end of each billing cycle—they don’t carry over to the next month.
- Standard plans include conservative requests-per-second limits; contact us if you need higher throughput.
- If your monthly credit allotment isn’t sufficient for your workload, reach out and we’ll tailor a plan to fit.
